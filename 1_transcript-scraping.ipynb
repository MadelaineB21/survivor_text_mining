      "</p><p>Kelly and I get along real well and we've been talking about strategy, and, you know, who's not contributing as much, and who would be best to vote off, and I think we-we've come to a mutual decision and we've talked to Sue about it.\n",
      "</p><p>Stacey came up to me, and it's, like, she don't like Rudy and she's, like, \"Oh, I think we're going to vote for Rudy,\" and vote him off 'cause he's so barking.\" Well, anybody's too barking and too bossy to Stacey because she doesn't move her ass.\n",

      "</p><p>Put them back in their slot, and take a seat.\n",
      "</p><p>We do this because-- as I'm sure you've discovered-- on the island, fire represents life.\n",

      "</p><p>Go ahead and have a seat.\n",
      "</p><p>Well, leave it to me to state the obvious, but this is not a place you want to be.\n",

      "</p><p>I'll fight to the finish, but, uh, I have my blisters and whatnot, but I'm-I'm doing okay.\n",
      "</p><p>What happened after Quest for Fire?\n",
      "</p><p>That was a great competition-- obviously, a lot at stake.\n",
      "</p><p>SONJA: Oh, God.\n",
      "</p><p>We came close.\n",
      "</p><p>We almost got it.\n",
      "</p><p>SUSAN: Aw, man, we were dragged down two times and we were right there.\n",
      "</p><p>We almost got it.\n",
      "</p><p>SUSAN: There's no way.\n",
      "</p><p>All right, guys, well... it's obviously a fun group.\n",
      "</p><p>This is not a pleasant process... No, not at all.\n",
      "</p><p>JEFF: And I know also, from listening to you guys talk, that there are a lot of different reasons why you're here.\n",
      "</p><p>Obviously, $1 million-- big motivator for anybody, but I'm sensing there could be personal reasons, different journeys you might be on that-that this encompasses.\n",
      "</p><p>Whatever it is, to fulfill that agenda, you have to survive tonight's Tribal Council.\n",
      "</p><p>That's the way it's set up.\n",
      "</p><p>So, what we're going to do is vote and how it will work is you'll come down here.\n",

      "</p><p>Fold it up, put it in the container, come back, and take a seat.\n",
      "</p><p>Now, once the votes are tallied, the decision is final and you have to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.\n",

      "That's the competition is taking home the flame, but what's the competition?\n",
      "We've got no freakin' idea.\n",
      "Welcome, tribes, to your first challenge.\n",
      "Congratulations on your first night on the island-- should be very proud.\n",
      "I know both of you guys have food.\n",
      "You found some fresh water and I think, Pagong, you guys had fire.\n",
      "[ cheers] Right on.\n",
      "A lot of work to get fire.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, it takes a lot of work.\n",
      "With the threat of rain always a constant, even if you guys did have fire, you're certainly not back there tending to them now.\n",
      "50 waterproof matches should certainly make that a lot easier.\n",
      "It's one of the things you're playing for tonight-- the other is this: I want everybody to touch this, get a good feel of this.\n",
      "This is your life on the island.\n",
      "This is the immunity idol.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Ah.\n",
      "Win this, you stay on the island a few days longer.\n",
      "Lose... you face tomorrow's Tribal Council, where one of you will be the first person voted off the island.\n",
      "Big enough stakes?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Okay, here's what we're doing.\n",
      "There are two rafts about 150 feet out in the water.\n",
      "Your job is to get your raft back to the beach.\n",
      "Along the way, a series of torches both in the water and on the land.\n",
      "First team to light all their torches and their side of the fire spirit wins immunity.\n",
      "Here are the rules: Each tribe member has to have one hand on the raft at all times-- at alltimes.\n",
      "Nobody can swim ahead.\n",
      "Nobody can fall behind.\n",
      "The other rule: you have to light every torch.\n",
      "Don't put me in the position of having to make a judgment call.\n",
      "I don't want to.\n",
      "There's too much at stake.\n",
      "Clear?\n",
      "ALL: Clear.\n",
      "All right, swim out to your rafts.\n",
      "Wait for my signal.\n",

      "I could always use a wash.\n",
      "RUDY: Before we got on the island here, I formed opinions about people, but I changed my mind just on that trip in.\n",
      "Rich, for one.\n",
      "I mean, this guy is... He's strong.\n",
      "He's smart.\n",
      "The guy surprises me.\n",
      "You know, he's fat, but he's... [ chuckling]: he's good.\n",
      "You can lay it over those.\n",
      "RICHARD: I like Rudy.\n",
      "I'm not bothered by his straightforwardness at all.\n",
      "I don't think it's even a problem.\n",
      "I-I like it that he's saying \"Hey, do this,\" or, \"Hey, do that,\" but people are thinking of that as very direct and arrogant.\n",
      "That's the word I'm hearing, and I'm thinking to myself \"Well, they think he'sarrogant; Oh, my God, I'm out of here!\" [ thuds] Oh, my gosh.\n",
      "What do we got?\n",
      "The good news is we'll be having fire tonight.\n",
      "The bad news is one of us won't be here to enjoy it.\n",
      "We got Tribal Council tonight.\n",
      "\"Pack your bags, get ready to go, which one it will be, the world will soon know.\" KELLY: Unfortunately, we're going to have to vote somebody off.\n",
      "There's going to be a lot of tension and one of us is going to leave.\n",
      "Well, what time we got to do this at?\n",
      "It just said, \"Get ready to go.\" Just, \"Pack your bags, get ready to go.\" I can't believe we have to pack up.\n",
      "We're just getting settled.\n",
      "Well, somebody's gone.\n",
      "So, it's time to think about who are they going to vote for?\n",
      "Why are they going to vote?\n",
      "I've narrowed it down to four.\n",
      "I'm one of them.\n",
      "Well, it could mean a lot uh, either staying or being voted out.\n",
      "You know, last night's competition, I really feel responsible because I couldn't keep up and I was dragged totally off my feet.\n",
      "I do feel that that stumble probably cost us the immunity challenge, and that's a big one.\n",
      "Up until, uh, probably last night, I never gave it a second thought about who I was going to vote off or if I got voted off, but after last night, uh... I thought about it then, and I decided then.\n",
      "I feel pretty secure, actually, about the vote tonight.\n",
      "Kelly and I get along real well and we've been talking about strategy, and, you know, who's not contributing as much, and who would be best to vote off, and I think we-we've come to a mutual decision and we've talked to Sue about it.\n",
      "Stacey came up to me, and it's, like, she don't like Rudy and she's, like, \"Oh, I think we're going to vote for Rudy,\" and vote him off 'cause he's so barking.\" Well, anybody's too barking and too bossy to Stacey because she doesn't move her ass.\n",
      "The chicks think I'm voting for one person, and I'm not.\n",
      "This is Tribal Council, where each week one member will be voted off the island.\n",
      "Last night, in a crushing defeat Tagi lost the immunity challenge, so, tonight, they will come here and vote the first person off.\n",
      "It all begins with a dangerous hike through the jungle.\n",
      "With so little time to get acquainted, everyone is vulnerable.\n",
      "Rich's talk-versus-action approach may be more annoying than helpful.\n",
      "Sonja's tumble cost them dearly.\n",
      "One thing's for certain: At Tribal Council, youare held accountable for your actions.\n",
      "Therewill be a vote.\n",
      "Someoneis going home.\n",
      "I see torches.\n",
      "Oh, that looks pretty hairy.\n",
      "[ birds chirping] [ gong sounds] Make our way around.\n",
      "We begin Tribal Council with a ritual.\n",
      "Behind each of you is a torch.\n",
      "I'd like you to grab the torch and approach the fire.\n",
      "Go ahead and dip your torches in the flame and light them.\n",
      "Put them back in their slot, and take a seat.\n",
      "We do this because-- as I'm sure you've discovered-- on the island, fire represents life.\n",
      "These torches now represent your life, your identity here at Tribal Council.\n",
      "The good news is you will take these torches with you when you leave so you will have fire, and you will bring them back with you to each Tribal Council.\n",
      "Go ahead and have a seat.\n",
      "Well, leave it to me to state the obvious, but this is not a place you want to be.\n",
      "You tread in dangerous territory every time you come here.\n",
      "Tribal Council is basically where you account for your actions on the island.\n",
      "Some of those actions will come back to help you.\n",
      "Some of them may come back to haunt you, but tonight, based on those actions, one of you will be the first person voted off the island.\n",
      "So, before we get to the vote, let's talk about what's been going on.\n",
      "I'm curious just about you guys getting here and finding this place.\n",
      "How was the journey over here?\n",
      "Saw two deadly snakes.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "SUSAN: Grand Canyon mud slides... It was great.\n",
      "It was fun.\n",
      "We're still starving.\n",
      "We've eaten but not really.\n",
      "SONJA: The competition is stiffer.\n",
      "The competition we had last night was tough, tougher than I had anticipated.\n",
      "How are you holding up, physically?\n",
      "SONJA: Well, pretty well, you know.\n",
      "I'll fight to the finish, but, uh, I have my blisters and whatnot, but I'm-I'm doing okay.\n",
      "What happened after Quest for Fire?\n",
      "That was a great competition-- obviously, a lot at stake.\n",
      "SONJA: Oh, God.\n",
      "We came close.\n",
      "We almost got it.\n",
      "SUSAN: Aw, man, we were dragged down two times and we were right there.\n",
      "We almost got it.\n",
      "SUSAN: There's no way.\n",
      "All right, guys, well... it's obviously a fun group.\n",
      "This is not a pleasant process... No, not at all.\n",
      "JEFF: And I know also, from listening to you guys talk, that there are a lot of different reasons why you're here.\n",
      "Obviously, $1 million-- big motivator for anybody, but I'm sensing there could be personal reasons, different journeys you might be on that-that this encompasses.\n",
      "Whatever it is, to fulfill that agenda, you have to survive tonight's Tribal Council.\n",
      "That's the way it's set up.\n",
      "So, what we're going to do is vote and how it will work is you'll come down here.\n",
      "You'll go across this bridge into our voting confessional.\n",
      "Write the name of the person you want to vote off-- large, clear letters.\n",
      "Hold it up, and speak your piece.\n",
      "We can't hear you.\n",
      "Fold it up, put it in the container, come back, and take a seat.\n",
      "Now, once the votes are tallied, the decision is final and you have to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.\n",
      "It's time to vote.\n",
      "You're first.\n",
      "Got to remove the weakest link in the... crew.\n",
      "Stacey.\n",
      "Um, tough call.\n",
      "[ sighs] Subtle reasons... I'm not sure exactly what they are.\n",
      "He's just... He's an ornery guy... doesn't really help that much.\n",
      "For a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know how to start fire... and he just criticizes everything.\n",
      "I'm picking her because I think she's the reason we lost yesterday.\n",
      "I'll miss his, uh, skills and, um, his speaking his mind openly.\n",
      "Before I read these votes, I just want to commend you on the courage it's taken to get this far.\n",
      "There were a lot of steps along the way.\n",
      "Any of you could've turned around.\n",
      "Nobody did, and in my book that gives you bragging rights for life.\n",
      "So, with that, I'll read the votes.\n",
      "First vote-- Sonja.\n",
      "Sonja.\n",
      "Stacey.\n",
      "Sonja.\n",
      "Rudy.\n",
      "Rudy.\n",
      "Rudy.\n",
      "That's three for Sonja and three for Rudy.\n",
      "The first person voted off the island... Sonja.\n",
      "Sonja, I need you to grab your torch and bring it to me.\n",
      "The tribe has spoken.\n",
      "Go get 'em, you guys.\n",
      "RICH: Thanks, Sonja.\n",
      "Thanks.Thank you.\n",
      "JEFF: Well, to the rest of you, I guess a somber congratulations.\n",
      "You've survived the Tribal Council.\n",
      "You have fire.\n",
      "You can head back to camp and I will see you tomorrow for the next challenge.\n",
      "Good night.\n",
      "JEFF: Next week, onSurvivor... I've been working my ass off and a lot of you have been laying on your ass watching me.\n",
      "Don't give me any of that ....\n",
